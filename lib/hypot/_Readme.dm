/*
	This library consists of a single global proc: hypot(x, y).

	Its implementation is taken from this Wikipedia page:

		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypot

	You can use this to calculate the distance between points in 2D,
		or the magnitude of a 2D vector.

	The magnitude of a 2D vector (x, y) is:
		hypot(x, y)

	The distance between points a and b is:
		hypot(b.x - a.x, b.y - a.y)
		(which is just the magnitude of the vector from a to b)
